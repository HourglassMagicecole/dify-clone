################################## DEVELOPMENT MODE CONFIGURATION ##################################
# WARNING: This configuration DISABLES all SSRF protections!
# Only use this in development environments. NEVER use in production!

# Override all previous access rules and allow everything
# This must be placed early in the configuration to take precedence

# Allow all ports (not just 80/443)
acl Dev_All_Ports port 1-65535

# Allow all connections including private networks
# This effectively bypasses all SSRF protections
http_access allow all

# Additional development conveniences
# Allow cache manager access from any source (useful for debugging)
http_access allow manager

# Log everything for debugging
debug_options ALL,1

# Note: Since we're allowing all, the deny rules in the main config won't be reached
